## Pandas

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

- fundamental difference between pandas and NumPy: NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column
- A table of data is stored as a pandas DataFrame
- Each column in a DataFrame is a Series
- You can do things by applying a method to a DataFrame or Series
- Getting data in to pandas from many different file formats or data sources is supported by read_* functions.
- Exporting data out of pandas is provided by different to_*methods.
- The head/tail/info methods and the dtypes attribute are convenient for a first check.
- .loc/.iloc for columns and rows
- When selecting subsets of data, square brackets [] are used.
- Inside these brackets, you can use a single column/row label, a list of column/row labels, a slice of labels, a conditional expression or a colon.
- The .plot.* methods are applicable on both Series and DataFrames
- By default, each of the columns is plotted as a different element (line, boxplot,â€¦)
- Any plot created by pandas is a Matplotlib object.
