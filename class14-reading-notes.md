What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture. In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

When are diversity efforts most successful? Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

Why do diverse companies perform better? Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
