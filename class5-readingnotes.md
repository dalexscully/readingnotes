Concepts of CSS
CSS modules
As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.

You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module.

For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and

features it contains.

In that module, you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the technology (also see the section below).

At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured; however, it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are

aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the same specification.

For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and

border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.

CSS specifications
All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by

standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group.

This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.

There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.

New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group — sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability,

other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement.
