## Reading Notes Repo Rd 1 Learning Markdowns

Overview
Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (

), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

Heading level 2 Heading Best Practices Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

...and after a heading. Without blank lines, this might not look right.

Paragraph Best Practices Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

Note: If you need to indent paragraphs in the output, see the section on how to indent (tab). ✅ Do this ❌ Don't do this Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

This can result in unexpected formatting problems.
Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs. Line Breaks To create a line break or new line (
), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Line Break Best Practices You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial. It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the
HTML tag.

For compatibility, use trailing white space or the
HTML tag at the end of the line.

There are two other options I don’t recommend using. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash () at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don’t require anything at the end of the line — just type return and they’ll create a line break.

✅ Do this ❌ Don't do this First line with two spaces after.
And the next line.
