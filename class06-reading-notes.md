What is node.js? Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? A JavaScript runtime the V8 engine that is enhanced with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

What is npm? npm is the world's largest Software Registry. Open-source developers use npm to share software.

What version of node are you running on your machine? The node version I am running on my mac is v18.10.0.

What version of npm are you running on your machine? The npm version I have on my computer installed is npm -v 8.19.2.

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? To install the JSHint tool, run the command npm install jshint in CLI. If I want to check if JSHint has been successfully installed, run the command jshint -version to see its version. Once this step is over, installation is complete

What is node used for? Node can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

6 Reasons for Pair Programming
What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? The 6 reasons for pair programming are Greater efficiency, Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students, Social skills, Job interview readiness, Work environment readiness.

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? In my experience, I found social skills to be the most beneficial in my opinion. A quote from the reading truly explains my opinion, "When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself."

How does pair programming work? While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
