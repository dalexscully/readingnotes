### Creating Hyperlinks
<hr>

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

The href attribute contains what information? The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

Sections of a page with fragment URLs
Pieces of media files with media fragments
Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
Email addresses with mailto: URLs
While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, web sites can with
What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers? Some ways we can ensure assesible links to our page for all users are Stong link text, onclick events, external links amd linking to non-HTML resources, link to a non-HTMLresource and skip links.

CSS Layout
CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
What is meant by “normal flow”? The elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave. And, as we began to discover, you can change how elements behave either by adjusting their position in normal flow or by removing them from it altogether. Starting with a solid, well-structured document that's readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage. It ensures that your content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads out the content of the page. In addition, since normal flow is designed to make a readable document, by starting in this way you're working with the document rather than struggling against it as you make changes to the layout.

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements.

___ positioning is the default for every html element. Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing special to see here."

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element. An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning? An absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. A fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code
Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. A Function Invocation is used to executes the function code and it is common to use the term “call a function” instead of “invoke a function”. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked. A function declaration is when a function has been declared, it can be used anytime inside a class or development scope whenever it's been called/invoked.

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly. Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes. Therefore, there's no difference between a parameter and a argument function.

6 Reasons for Pair Programming
Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey. My two picks of pair programming would be Greater efficiency and engaged collaboration.

Great efficiency is the ideal way of teaming up with a peer and tackling a mutual task together to get the most optimal outcome on any project. Engaged collaboration in my opinion have a greater impact on any particular situation for it illustrates two people are engaged and focus on the same task on hand to achieve the greatest outcome for success.
