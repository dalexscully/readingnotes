### Python Scope

- Python Scope
- Concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code
- Python scope concept uses a rule called LEGB rule
- LEGB - Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in
- Scope - in programming it means the area of a program where you can access a variable name
- Global Scope - name is available to all your code
- Local Scope - name is accessable only within a certain area
- Python names can be created through assignments, import operations, function definitions, argument definition in context of functions, class definition
- Python scopes are implemented as diciontaries that map names to objects aka namespaces
- Namespaces are stored in a special attribute called .dict

      # Will return a list of all names defined at top level of the module
      import sys
      sys.__dict__.keys()
<hr>

      # These methods are used to access ps1 name
      sys.ps1
      sys.__dict__['ps1']

- LEGB
  - Local - scope within a function. Names are created at function call not when defining. So the different function calls will create different scopes, even if you call the function recursively
  - Enclosing - scope that exist for nested function. This would be the outer scope of a nested function.
  - Global - top most scope
  - Built In - special python scope thats created whenever you run a script or open an ineractive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, fucntions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into python.

    def create_lazy_name():
        global lazy  # Create a global name, lazy
        lazy = 100
        return lazy

    create_lazy_name()

    lazy  # The name is now available in the global scope

- global keyword can be used to modify and create global names inside functions

<hr>

def func():
    var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
    def nested():
        nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
        var += 100

    nested()
    print(var)

func() # will return 200

- nonlocal keyword only works in nested functions
- can be used to modify variables one scope up in nested functions

    square = power_factory(2)
    square(10) # returns 100

    cube = power_factory(3)
    cube(10) # returns 1000

    cube(5) # returns 125
