If the picture is purely decorative, provide at least null alt text (alt=””). Avoid text in images. If it is impossible, we make sure that this text is repeated in alt text.

Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document? Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc. Most of the time, as web developers we want to have more specific control over the fonts used to display our text content. The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the computer used to see our web pages. There is no way to know this in every case, but the web safe fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems

What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements? Font size (set with the font-size property) can take values measured in most of these units (and others, such as percentages). A font style is used to turn italic text on or off. Possible values are as follows (you'll rarely use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some reason). A font-weight sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you have many font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold, -black, etc.), but realistically you'll rarely use any of them except for normal and bold
