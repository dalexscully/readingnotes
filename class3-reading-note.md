HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
Learn HTML
When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? The ul element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square.

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? The li type attribute in HTML is used to specify the type of a list items. This attribute also defines the style of the bullet point of the list items.

When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document? The ol and ul elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with the ol element, the order is meaningful. Whereas, ul order in the list is meaningless.

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list? The two ways that a number can be change on list items provided by an ordered list would be first 'using roman numeral type' and secondly 'using the start attribute.'

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”? The CSS properties of Margin and Padding. A margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between a box and other elements. A padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties. The role margin and padding played in the "The box model" can be characterized as in the standard box model, if you give a box an inline-size and a block-size (or width and a height) attributes, this defines the inline-size and block-size (width and height in horizontal languages) of the content box. Any padding and border is then added to those dimensions to get the total size taken up by the box.

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model. The four parts of an HTML elements box are: Margin, padding, border and size.

The size can be change by adding CSS to the .alternate class to make a size adjust accordingly to width and height.
Margin: The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values.
Border: The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the box.
Padding: The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border.
Learn JS
.What data types can you store inside of an Array? An array we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. Array can also mix data types in a single array.

Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why? People, place and numbers are valid JavaScript array, for Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value.

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do?

Assignment(=): The simple assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operation evaluates to the assigned value Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
Addition assignment (+=): The addition assignment operator (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. The types of the two operands determine the behavior of the addition assignment operator.
Subtraction assignment (-=): The subtraction assignment operator (-=) subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
Multiplication assignment (=): The multiplication assignment operator (=) multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.
Division assignment (/=): The division assignment operator (/=) divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.
Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why. let a = 10; let b = 'dog'; let c = false;

// evaluate this (a + c) + b; The result is 10.

Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. Imagine a child being asked for help with a chore by their mother or father. The parent might say "Hey sweetheart! If you help me by going and doing the shopping, I'll give you some extra allowance so you can afford that toy you wanted." In JavaScript, we could represent this like so:

let shoppingDone = false; let childsAllowance;

if (shoppingDone === true) { childsAllowance = 10; } else { childsAllowance = 5; }

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript. We will want to us a Loop for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete. I would want to use a Loop if I wanted to draw 100 random squares to have it be repeated many times in different random order.

Things I want to know more about
I want to drive deeper into Arrays and Loop for I find them very interested.
