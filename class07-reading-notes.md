## REST and API Keys

Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? The HTTP protocol is the part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

What does a GET do? The get syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up

What does a POST do? The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the Content-Type header. We use Express. js in order to create a server and to make requests (GET, POST, etc).

What does PUT do? The PUT method is most often used to update an existing resource. If you want to update a specific resource (which comes with a specific URI), you can call the PUT method to that resource URI with the request body containing the complete new version of the resource you are trying to update.

What does PATCH do? The PATCH request method is used to modify a resource on the server partially.
