Psychological Safety
The whole premise of this article revolved completely around psychological mindset of team collaborations. For anything in life to be successful team work is an essential component to accomplishing that task. Things such as marriage, a sports team, government entities and companies/corporations whether big or small needs team collaborations in order to be successful. To get an aggregate positive outcome team contribution stems from multiple faucets which I will elaborate in this article.

However, how can a team be successful? In part, when dealing with so many different personality and attitudes? This can surely make team collaboration very daunting and difficult. I really find it very interest how the auther assimalated a few examples in her article which I will use in my reading-note. I do agree it is feasible to have people in a team setting that are able to share their most intimate secret so everyone can feel at ease without ridicule or shame and have that human element in the team to form a cohesive unit rather than it just be a job and business as usual. This piece of the article stated, "What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor." I find this part of the article heart warming and really does make a difference how a team can be free and preform and accomplish exceptional things.

I myself find working on a team is more effective than working alone. Please note, I surely can accomplish the task at hand once required, but if a project can be more concise and effective in a team setting them by all means I always welcome that atmosphere, but this can only work once everyone is one the same page. As stated in the, "For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work."

It is essential to note that everyone will not get along no matter how smart and intelligent individuals are. The author Charles Duhigg pointed out early in his article that Julia Rozovsky had a rather unique experience at Yale while studying for her MBA degree. It was noted " Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn’t turn out that way. ‘‘There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It wasn’t like that for me.’’

Instead, Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. ‘‘I always felt like I had to prove myself,’’ she said. The team’s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. ‘‘People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.’’ As Mr. Charles stated, Ms. Julia had her experience at an elite school, but find it rather difficult to work with others that wasn't incline with her ideologies. So she did the obvious and found a different were she excelled. In essence, building trust and openness and finding the right fit makes a difference for any team to be successful.
