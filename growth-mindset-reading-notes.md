# The Growth Mindset

I am about to venture on a new challenge pertaining to 401 Advance Python and my mindset is to accomplish this course in its entirety, all in which, to have a firm knowledge and understanding of all the lessons learned along the way. I know in order to develop, enhance and grow my mindset I will of to constantly challenge myself and constantly learning new things. Regarding the article, "Upgrage your technical skills with deliberate practice." I comprehend the author's point of view to get outside the comfort zone and practice and challenge oneself daily. A quote from the author here emphasis my point of view "The challenges have to push you just outside your comfort zone. It's no use trying to solve a complex problem in code if you can't yet iterate over an array. The gap in your knowledge that the challenge forces you to overcome needs to be surmountable." I know from past experience that learning anything new that requires hard work and dedication can be a challenge at times, but with a goal in mind and a strong will and determination all is possible to accomplish. "The goals of the challenges should be picked such that achieving them teaches you something new. It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what you learned on the way."

## The power of believing that you can improve

This amazing video surely impacted me in a way I am unable to express in words. I myself experience this growthe mindset as a child, so this video I can personally relate to. She illustrated evidence that shows everyone has the ability to learn once placed in the right environvement with the right tools. It's amazing what equality and exposure can have on ones mental development. It is remarkable how much imorovement those school kids from Harlem, the South Bronx and Indian conservation school demonstrated all by inclusion, opportunity and have that growht mindset that will challenge their learning mental capacity.

## The power of passion and perseverance

I am a true believer in that "grit" builds a solid foundation for lasting success. To succeed in life, I am absolutely a believer that to have passion and preserverance to see things through to the very end is what enables a person to achieve the success they want in life. That fire to absolutely want to succeed that growth mindset is what will compel people through the difficulties in life. I am flabergasted how much this ideology Angela Lee presented in this video makes so much sense and is a true depiction of the facts of life. 

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

[Alain de Botton "A kinder, gentler philosophy of success"](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

The world has changed dramatically over the past 30-40 years are so. I do believe with the creation of certain platforms such as FaceBook, Twiiter and Instgram has surely these days emphasis to people what success should look like. Those that can showoff their success are praised, and those who are not so fortunate are looked down upon as failures, and surely this is what leading people who think they are less unfortunate most often tends to hurt themselves. The evolution of human nature as somewhat distorted our reality in life to believe if we don't fit into certain lifestyle then we somehow failed in life. I do believe this has to cease for the future generations will only be consumed to be successful by any means necessary and that can be detrimental to our very well-being.
