## Basic Data Structures

*8 Common Data Structures every Programmer must know*

Data Structures are of the most important fundamental in computer science/software engineering and it is well used in data science. As quoted by the author of this article " Data structure is a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently."

#### **Below I have provided a few visual basic terminologies**:

*What is an Array?*

1. Arrays
An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. Also, an Array are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

*What are Linked Lists?*

2. Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Random access is not possible.

3. Stacks

*What is a Stack?*

A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

- Push: Insert an element on to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Delete the topmost element and return it.

*What are Queues?*

4. Queues

A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

- Enqueue: Insert an element to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue: Delete the element from the beginning of the queue.

*What are Hash Tables?*

5. Hash Tables

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them.

h(k) = k % m

- h: Hash function
- k: Key of which the hash value should be determined
- m: Size of the hash table (number of slots available). A prime value that is not close to an exact power of 2 is a good choice for m.

*What are Trees?*

6. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together.

In addition:

- Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree (BST), is where data is organized in a hierarchical structure. This data structure stores values in sorted order.

Let x be a node in a binary search tree.

- If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key ≤ x.key
- If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y.key ≥ x.key

7. Heaps

*What are Heaps?*

A **Heap** is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.

*What are Graphs?*

8. Graphs

A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.

There are two diffeent types of graphs as show below:

**Directed Graphs**

A graph G is said to be a directed graph if all its edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex.

**Undirected Graphs**

A graph G is said to be an undirected graph if all its edges have no direction. It can go in both ways between the two vertices.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to fully grasp the concept of Data Structure since it is the fundamental building block for computer science and software engineering. This aritcle breaks down a few component that I will do extensive research to gain more of an understanging of Data structure.
