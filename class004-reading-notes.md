# Classes and Objects

In referenece to this article. I have attached a link explaining in details the fundamental of classes and objects.

[Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

A preview of a basic class function:

class MyClass:

    variable = "sandwich"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable

Here are a few key points in Python:

- Classes are created by keyword class
- A class is like a blueprint while an instanct is a copy of the class with actual values.
- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instantes share the attributes and the behavior of the class.

## Thinking Recursively

My understaning of recursion is breaking problems down into smaller problems, so each smaller problems can be easily deciphered. 

- A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
- All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.
1. Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case: 
2. As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:

## Things I want to know more about
Recursion is broken down into many movable parts. It's definitely a topic in which I will do a deep drive to comprehend the material fully in how it is structured.
