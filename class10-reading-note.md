Debugging
Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. A syntax error occurs due to fault in the program syntax. A logical error occurs due to a fault in the algorithm. In compiled languages, the compile indicates the syntax error with the location and what the error is. The programmer has to detect the error by himself.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. I have mostly experience so far simply spell check and forgetting to put semi-colons, brackets, capitalizing verses lower case words. Inputting the wrong code and when asked for help from a TA. I then realize how simply of a fix the error was. These are more so the frequent errors I have committed and trying not to keep making the same mistakes over again.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? I am so far excited for the challenge and eager to learn and challenge myself everyday. The entire course and had a impact so far in my long term goals. I am eager to get into the field and make an impact.

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

Define what a breakpoint is. Breakpoints, lists the breakpoints set on the page. In example.js, a breakpoint has been set on the statement listItems.push(inputNewItem.value).

What is the call stack? The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
