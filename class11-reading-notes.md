## MongoDB-and-Mongoose

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL Vs NoSQL

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? SQL databases are perfectly suited for storing and processing structured data.

Give a real world example. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

Give a real world example. NoSQL do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

Which type of database is best for scalability? In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.

## sql vs nosql

What does SQL stand for? Stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database

What is a relational database?

What type of structure does a relational database work with? A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

What is a ‘schema’? Schema is the organization or structure for a database, while in artificial intelligence (AI) a schema is a formal expression of an inference rule. For the former, the activity of data modeling leads to a schema.

What is a NoSQL database? NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types

How does it work? NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as “not only SQL” and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

What is inside of a MongoDB database? The Easiest Way to Deploy, Operate, and Scale MongoDB in the Cloud in Just a Few Clicks. Cloud-Hosted Database Managed by MongoDB. Flexible, Fast & Easy. Get Started for Free. Supporting AWS. Types: Shared, Dedicated, Serverless.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents. With appropriate schema design, single-record atomicity is acceptable for lots of applications.
